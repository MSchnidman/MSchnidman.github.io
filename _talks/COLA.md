I was invited to present to undergraduate students on the intersections of music and economics, and how we can use economic tools to understand the music industry.

The presentation can be found [here](https://mschnidman.github.io/files/Schnidman_COLA_Presentation_Rev2_1610.pdf). 

Note: This presentation was cancelled because of a tragic event on Grounds.

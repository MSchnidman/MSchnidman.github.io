I was invited to present to a graduate class in industrial organization on empirical demand estimation on the airline industry, focusing especially on the the Berry, Carnal, Spiller (2006) method of estimating demand for flights. I discussed this method in the context of Berry and Jia (2010) and Ciliberto and Williams (2014).

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Virginia, expecting to graduate in May 2025. My research interests lie in industrial organization and applied econometrics, with a particular focus on the impact of recommender systems on the music industry, as I explore in my job market paper, "[Playing to the Algorithm: How Spotify's Recommendations Shape Music Production](https://mschnidman.github.io/research/music-ex-machina)." I also research digital platforms, media economics, and the economics of AI. 

I am on the academic job market for the 2024-2025 cycle.

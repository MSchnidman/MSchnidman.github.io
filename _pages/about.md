I am a Senior Researcher at Microsoft's Office of the Chief Economist. I received my PhD in Economics from the University of Virginia in May 2025. My research interests lie in industrial organization and applied econometrics, with a particular focus on the impact of recommender systems on the music industry. I also research digital platforms, media economics, and the economics of AI.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Virginia, expecting to graduate in May 2025. My research interests lie in Industrial Organization, Digital Economics and Quantiative Marketing, with a particular focus on the impact of recommender systems on the music industry, as I explore in my job market paper, "Music Ex Machina: Has Spotify Changed the Sound of Music?" I also research digital platforms, media economics, and the economics of AI.

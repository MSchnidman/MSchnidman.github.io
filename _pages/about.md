I am a Senior Researcher at Microsoft's Office of the Chief Economist. I wil receive my PhD in Economics from the University of Virginia in May 2025. My research interests lie in industrial organization and applied econometrics, with a particular focus on the impact of recommender systems on the music industry, as I explore in my paper, "[Playing to the Algorithm: How Spotify's Recommendations Shape Music Production](https://mschnidman.github.io/research/music-ex-machina)." I also research digital platforms, media economics, and the economics of AI.

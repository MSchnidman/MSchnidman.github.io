Intro to Econometrics (ECON 3720)
======
I was responsible for leading the weekly discussion sections, during which I reviewed problem sets. I also graded homework assignments, and held virtual office hours. Additionally, I helped manage course logistics, including grade distributions, responding to emails and Slack messages, and calculating final grades. The course was taught by Professor [Jonathan Colmer](https://economics.virginia.edu/people/profile/jmc4qg).

Econometric Methods (ECON 4720)
======
I was responsible for leading weekly discussion sections, in which I taught students how to implement the econometric methods covered in class through statistical programming (MATLAB and Stata). I also graded assignments and exams, held office hours, and helped manage course logistics. The course was taught by Professor [Lidia Kosenkova](https://economics.virginia.edu/people/profile/lk7cb).

My MATLAB code for the course can be found [here](MSchnidman/MSchnidman.github.io/files/Matlab_Econometric_Methods.7z)

Mathematical Microeconomics (ECON 3110)
======
I was responsible for designing and grading problem sets, as well as leading discussion sections. In these sections, I reinforced the material covered during lectures and cover selected assignment questions. This course was taught by Professor [Maxim Engers](https://economics.virginia.edu/people/profile/mpe2m).

My assignments for this class can be found [here](MSchnidman/MSchnidman.github.io/files/Econ_3110_Assignments.zip)

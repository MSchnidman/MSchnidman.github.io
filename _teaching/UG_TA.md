At the University of Virginia, I have served as a teaching assistant for Economics 3720 (Intro to Econometrics) and Economics 4720 (Econometric Methods).

Intro to Econometrics
======
In this course, I was responsible for leading the weekly discussion sections, during which I reviewed problem sets, grading homework assignments, and holding office hours. I also helped manage course logistics, including grade distributions, responding to emails and Slack messages, and calculating final grades. The course was taught by Professor [Jonathan Colmer](https://economics.virginia.edu/faculty/jonathan-colmer).

Econometric Methods
======
In this course, I was responsible for leading weekly discussion sections, in which I taught students how to implement the econometric methods covered in class through statistical programming (MATLAB and Stata). I also graded assignments and exams, held office hours, and helped manage course logistics. The course was taught by Professor [Lidia Kosenkova](https://economics.virginia.edu/faculty/lidia-kosenkova).

My MATLAB code for the course can be found here.

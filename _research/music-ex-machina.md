I examine how recommender systems have influenced the music industry and shaped music production over the last decade. Using a structural model of Spotify's recorded music industry, I analyze consumer behavior, platform recommendations, and rightsholders' decisions. Results indicate that streaming services and recommender systems correlate with a 40-second decrease in average song length on Billboard's Hot 100. The model estimates a fixed cost of $79,000 for songs entering Spotify's Top 200, with an 8% price-cost margin. Counterfactual analysis shows that without recommender systems, songs would be 50 seconds longer on average, but consumer welfare would be 13% lower. While reducing music variety, these systems have increased song quantity and overall consumer welfare.

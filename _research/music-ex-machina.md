Recommender systems, known for suggesting products based on user preferences, are a cornerstone of the digital economy.
While most research on recommender systems has focused on pricing algorithms or their impact on consumption, 
little research exists on how recommender systems affect product design and characteristics.
I examine how recommender systems affect product characteristics in the recorded music industry, and whether they result in more homogeneous songs.

Because recommender systems act as a bridge between consumers and producers,
 guiding users towards certain tracks, producers may prioritize the recommender system's preferences over diverse consumer tastes in creating songs.
 This focus could narrow variety in music as creators aim to please the algorithm rather than a broad range of consumer preferences.

My research contribution is a structural econometric model of the interactions between consumers, the recommender system, and forward-looking producers,
which I estimate using data from Spotify. Using this model, I can estimate the effect of the recommender system on song characteristics,
 and whether it drives producers to design more homogeneous music. I can also use this model to test how changes to the recommender system, or the relationship between producers and the recommender system, affect the variety in music.

I find that consumers are likelier to listen to newer and more danceable songs.
Additionally, premium users are less likely to skip songs, and users are more likely to skip songs later in the streaming session.
Notably, consumers do not exhibit statistically significant preferences for longer songs.

I estimate the recommender system on those songs Spotify recommended to consumers in my subsample, 
representing about 15\% of the song choices. I find that the recommender system is more likely to surface shorter songs, as 
well as more acoustic songs. These insights suggest that music producers might be inclined to create shorter songs, considering that consumers show no strong preference regarding song length, and the recommender system has a preference towards shorter tracks.
My supply side estimation is in progress.

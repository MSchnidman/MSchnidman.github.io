excerpt: 'This paper uses a structural estimation of the demand for novice art to understand causal factors for such demand on digital platforms like Etsy.'

We estimate demand for novice art on Etsy. We use lab-based conjoint analysis to generate data on consumer choices and use these data to build a structural model of demand for novice artwork, e.g., paintings. The counterfactuals from our model estimation will help us understand how changes in the listing characteristics of novice artwork like paintings sold on e-commerce platforms can affect demand and prices paid.

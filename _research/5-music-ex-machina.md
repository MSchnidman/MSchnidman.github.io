Abstract:

I examine how recommender systems have influenced the music industry and shaped
music production. Using a structural model of the recorded music industry, I analyze
consumer behavior, platform recommendations, and rightsholder release decisions.
I estimate a fixed cost of $170,000 for songs that enter Spotify’s Top 200. Counterfactual
analysis shows that with randomized recommendations, fewer songs would
enter the market, reducing consumer welfare by 4%. The songs that do enter would
be 33 seconds longer on average and more heterogeneously long. Popularity-based
recommendations that do not account for individual taste would generate a superstar
effect—increasing gross profit margins for songs that enter the market to 40%—but
reducing consumer welfare by 13%. Although recommender systems have reduced
overall variety in music, they have also enabled additional entry and increased consumer
welfare.

I examine how recommender systems have influenced the music industry and shaped music production over the last decade. 
Using a structural model of the recorded music industry, I analyze consumer behavior, platform recommendations, and rightsholder release decisions.
I estimate a fixed cost of $80,000 for songs entering Spotifyâ€™s Top 200, with a 26% gross profit margin. 
Counterfactual analysis shows that with randomized recommendations, fewer songs would enter the market, reducing consumer welfare by 4%.
The songs that do enter would be 8 seconds longer on average and more heterogeneous in length.
Popularity-based recommendations that do not account for individual taste would generate a superstar effect, increasing gross profit margins for songs that enter the market to 48%, but reducing consumer welfare by 16%.
While recommender systems have reduced overall variety in music, they have enabled additional entry and increased consumer welfare.

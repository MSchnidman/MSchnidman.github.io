I examine how recommender systems have influenced the music industry and shaped music production over the last decade. 
Using a structural model of Spotify's recorded music industry, I analyze consumer behavior, platform recommendations, and rightsholders' decisions.
Reduced-form results indicate that streaming services and recommender systems correlate with a 40-second decrease in average song length on Billboard's Hot 100. 
Using my model, I estimate a fixed cost of $85,000 for songs entering Spotify's Top 200, with an 11% price-cost margin.
Counterfactual analysis shows that without recommender systems, songs would be 10 seconds longer on average, but consumer welfare would be 9\% lower.
While reducing music variety, these systems have increased song quantity and overall consumer welfare.

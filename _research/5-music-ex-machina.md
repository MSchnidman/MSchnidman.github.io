Abstract:

I examine how recommender systems have influenced the music industry and shaped music production. Using a structural model of the recorded music industry, I analyze
consumer behavior, platform recommendations, and rightsholder release decisions. I estimate a fixed cost of $170,000 for songs entering Spotifyâ€™s Top 200. Counterfactual analysis shows that with randomized recommendations, fewer songs would enter the market, reducing consumer welfare by 4%. The songs that do enter would be 33 seconds longer on average and more heterogeneous in length. Popularity-based recommendations that do not account for individual taste would generate a superstar effect, increasing gross profit margins for songs that enter the market to 40%, but reducing consumer welfare by 13%. While recommender systems have reduced overall
variety in music, they have enabled additional entry and increased consumer welfare.
